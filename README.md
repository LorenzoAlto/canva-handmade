I made this editor using bootstrap for the layout and media queries for the responsiveness.
All the functionalities (like adding an element, edit, delete ecc) are all made by hand with JQuery

This was my first experiment with JQuery and it is pretty powerful.
Feel free to commit any changes that can make the code better.
